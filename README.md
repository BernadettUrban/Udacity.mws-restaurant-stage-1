#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Specification

You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

### Evan's Notes
- I had issues getting the Python server to work with service workers so i ended up using NPM http-server package https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
- It wasnt clear if flexbox was not to be used, i googled it a bit and apparently its not considered a CSS framework, so i went for a gamble with it.
- Port to use is still 8000
